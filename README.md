### Goal and Value of the Application
The goal of this application is to provide a shop interface for Greenwood Silver, a small independent jeweler currently without a web presence. This site will allow users to better peruse Greenwood Metals available merchandise. Users can filter and sort by type of jewlery and cost as well as sort by date added. Finally users can add and remove items from a cart which calculates the total of their selected items.
